This code calculates the conductivities in a basic tight-binding model (2D square lattice).


############
DOWNLOADING:

In command line on a bash termianl (represented here with the "$" sign), type:
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/mnmpdadish/afmconductivities


###########
COMPILING:

to compile, go in the "afmconductivities" directory (where the "makefile" is) and type:
$ make


#############
DEPENDENCIES:

To compile, the system only need the compiler gcc.
Any version should be sufficient.
Tested with gcc-4.8.


####
RUN:

To run the code, gererate a "model.dat" file and type:
$ ./afmCond

An example of a model.dat file is contained in the "example" directory.
The "model.dat" file should contain the following parameters:

ETA   Lorentzian broadening of the spectral weight
t     nearest neighbor hopping energy
tp    second nearest neighbor hopping energy
tpp   third nearest neighbor hopping energy
M     antiferromagntic energy

nMu   number of Mu to calculate
muMin minimum Mu of the loop
muMax maximum Mu of the loop

nOmega number of frequency (omega) to calculate for the integral
nK     number of K point to calculate (in both direction k_x and k_y) for the integral
beta   inverse of temperature (beta = 1/T)

amplitudeCutoff        value of the derivative of the Fermi Dirac cutoff used to determine the frequency cutoff

##########################
WARGING: this program is very basic. It essentially calculate a multidimensional integral with a basic grid. 
nK and nOmega specify how fine the sampling is. It is important to use the correct nK, nOmega to 
not integrate noise. As a rule of thumbs, a smaller ETA requires more nK points. nOmega should be
to obtain the same precision. Once you get a solution from the program, changes these parameter by a 
huge factor to test if the integral converged. 



########
RESULTS: 

The code generate a "conductivities.dat" file. The first 2 columns give the 
chemical potential "mu" and the density "n". The rest of the columns are the 
different conductivities (sigma, alpha, beta) you can calculate from integration
of the equations (see DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.88.205109 for details). The indices
1 and 2 refer to band 1 (lower) and 2 (upper) of the antiferromagnet. To plot 
the Hall number in gnuplot for example, one can do:

gnuplot> plot 'conductivities.dat' u 2:(($3+$4)*($3+$4)/($5+$6)) w lp, x, x-1, x+1

EXAMPLE:

An example of results are shown in the "example" directory. See the README in this
directory.
