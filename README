This code calculates the conductivities in a basic tight-binding model (2D square lattice).



COMPILING:

to compile, simply do:
$ make



DEPENDENCIES:

The system only use the compiler gcc (any version should be sufficient).



RUN:

To run the code, gererate a "model.dat" file and type:
$ ./afmCond

The model file should contain the following parameters:
ETA   0.1
t     nearest neighbor hopping energy
tp    second nearest neighbor hopping energy
tpp   third nearest neighbor hopping energy
M     antiferromagntic energy

nMu   number of Mu to calculate
muMin minimum Mu of the loop
muMax maximum Mu of the loop

nOmega number of frequency (omega) to calculate
nK     number of K point to calculate (in both direction k_x and k_y)
beta   inverse of temperature (beta = 1/T)

amplitudeCutoff        value of the derivative of the Fermi Dirac cutoff used to determine the frequency cutoff



RESULTS: 

The code generate a "conductivities.dat" file. The different columns are the 
different conductivities (sigma, alpha, beta) you can calculate from integration
of the equations (see DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.88.205109 for details). The indices
1 and 2 refer to band 1 and 2 of the antiferromagnet. To plot the Hall number in 
gnuplot for example, one can do:

gnuplot> plot 'conductivities.dat' u 2:(($3+$4)*($3+$4)/($5+$6)) w lp, x, x-1, x+1



EXAMPLE:

An example of results are shown in the "example" directory. Running the program with
the "model.dat" in this directory should reproduce the "conductivities.dat" file.
