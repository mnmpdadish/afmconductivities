USAGE:

Running the program with the "model.dat" present in this directory should reproduce 
the "conductivities.dat" file in the "results" subdirectory. Type:

$ ./afmCond

in this directory to obtain your "conductivities.dat".


PLOTTING:

To plot the Hall number as a function of hole density relative to half filling 
in gnuplot for example, one can do:

gnuplot> plot 'conductivities.dat' u 2:(($3+$4)*($3+$4)/($5+$6)) w lp, x, x-1, x+1
